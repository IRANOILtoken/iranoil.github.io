Executive Summary
IRANOIL is a utility token built on the TON blockchain, inspired by the strategic value of crude oil.
It provides a transparent, fast, and secure foundation for digital transactions, investments, and
energy-related Web3 projects.
50% of the total supply (10,000,000,000 tokens) has been distributed across 21 wallet addresses to
ensure decentralization and transparency.
The remaining supply will be allocated to DEX liquidity, community incentives, and token burn
events according to the roadmap.
